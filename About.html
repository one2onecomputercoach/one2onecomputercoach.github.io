                <div class="lead"><p><strong>My Journey</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">I found yoga and meditation late in life and at a time when I was focused on improving my health and actively searching for healthier ways of living. I had always heard that yoga would be good for my back pain and that meditation would reduce stress, so both were on my list of things to try. The first time I went to a gentle yoga class, I ended up with sore muscles for a week. I left that class without knowing what Yoga was really about, and I was in so much pain that I never went back for another class again. My first time meditating was through a free 21-Day Meditation Experience with Oprah and Deepak. I had a difficult time settling my mind and I wasn’t sure if I was doing it correctly, so I ended up quitting after a week. Both failed attempts were discouraging but I’m glad I didn’t let myself give up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>I finally started feeling like I was meditating correctly, once I took the time to research meditation and learn more about how it works and what to do. I was able to finish an entire 21-Day Meditation Experience and many more after that. With regular practice, I began to notice that life was getting easier. It took time and changes happened in small shifts, but I was able to heal my life in a much deeper way than I had ever anticipated. I was inspired to learn more about meditation from The Chopra Center, where I learned what I needed to know to create a deeper more personalized meditation practice. In doing so, my being has been illuminated in the most unexpected ways. I also continued practicing gentle styles of yoga on my own at home. But it wasn’t until I was in Unified Yoga Teacher Training, that I learned yoga in a way that made me fall in love and develop my own practice. Getting formal instruction, in both meditation and yoga, was the greatest thing I've ever done for myself.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The difference that meditation and yoga has made in my life has been immeasurable. Learning to meditate has expanded my awareness and allowed me to see myself and my life as a realm of infinite possibilities. Through regular meditation, I’ve experienced more personal growth in a few years than I had in forty. It’s not that higher education, motherhood or a career in service were not transformative enough to be catalysts for personal growth; those experiences were pivotal and I grew from them, but they were all external. I didn’t truly find myself or understand the laws of the Universe until I stopped to experience what was within. It was inside myself, where I found my true Self and all the answers I had been seeking. Through continuing education and personal practice, my learning and healing journey continues. It's really only the beginning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>My Lineage</strong><br></p><p><em>Certified Yoga Teacher (CYT 200)</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;trained in techniques of teaching yoga postures, pranayama, meditation and philosophy in a Unified Yoga Teacher Training with <a href="https://www.yogaalliance.org/TeacherPublicProfile/tid/158983" class="text-black" target="_blank">Troy McPeak</a>, who teaches the philosophy of a Unified approach to teaching yoga.  This approach is inclusive of ancient wisdom traditions, explores different styles of yoga and allows the yogi or yogini to “unify” any or all of the styles into their own style.  It also offers variety for students of all levels, while allowing yoga practitioners the time and space to do their own yoga in a way that is safe and comfortable for their anatomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chopra Center Certified Instructor in Primordial Sound Meditation</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed a Meditation Certification Program at <a href="https://chopra.com" class="text-black" target="_blank">The Chopra Center</a>, which included advanced meditation techniques through Primordial Sound Meditation.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The lineage of this ancient meditation practice traces back to the eighth century Vedic sage Adi Shakara.  Through my training I studied Advaita, Vedanta, advanced Vedic philosophy and the sciences of Ayurveda, yoga, mantras and meditation.  Having the experience of learning these wisdom traditions has been an honor and a gift to my soul. Gratitude to my teachers Dr. Deepak Chopra, Roger Gabriel, Pandit Vamadeva Shastri, Yogini Shambhavi and to my community of Chopra Certified Instructors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><em>“You have a treasure within you that is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer” – Eckhart Tolle</em></p></div>
